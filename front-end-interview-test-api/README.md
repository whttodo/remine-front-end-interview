### Front End Interview Test API

#### Usage
This fake server uses `faker.js` and `json-server` in order to serve up fake data for our front end test.

Run default server with `npm start`, this will serve up the contents in `db.json`.

You may create a new `db.json` file by running the `generateDB.js` file and adjusting the `numberOfEntries` value contained inside it (minimum number of entries is 100).

We will be checking the final submission against the `final-test.json` file.

You may launch the server with the `final-test.json` file by running `npm run check`.
